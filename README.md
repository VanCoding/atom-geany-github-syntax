# geany-github-syntax

Really like [iA Writer's][iaw] colors, but want them elsewhere?  This is a port to Atom, based on the [vim theme][pencil-vim].  It's a quick and dirty port so far while kicking the tires on atom, here's the [dark version][atom-pencil-dark].

![less example](https://github.com/VanCoding/atom-geany-github-syntax/blob/master/screenshot.png?raw=true)

If you'd like a companion theme for your iTerm, check out my [iTerm theme][pencil-iterm].
